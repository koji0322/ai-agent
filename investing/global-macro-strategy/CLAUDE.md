# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new, empty project. No source files, build system, or dependencies have been created yet.

## Project Context

- **Location**: `investing/global-macro-strategy/` within the parent repo at `/Users/matsubarakouji/ai-agent`
- **Purpose**: Global macro investment strategy tooling/analysis
- **Parent repo**: Contains `dev-learning-guides/` (Claude Code learning guides) and `gemini-test/` as sibling projects

## Repository Notes

- The git root is `/Users/matsubarakouji/ai-agent` — git commands should target that root, not this subdirectory
- When using `git` here, be aware that `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the parent directory
